            Inheritance in CSS is the ability of elements to inherit CSS properties from their parent (the element that
            contains them). It means that if a CSS rule is applied to a parent element on a page, it is also applied to
            its child elements, but there are exceptions. For example, if color and font are set for an element, then
            its child elements have the same colour and font (if they do not have their own definitions of these
            styles). But not all CSS properties are inherited. For some it doesn't make sense. For example, margins and
            widths are not inherited because it is unlikely that a child element requires the same margins as its parent
            element.
            In most cases, it is enough to use your common sense to understand which properties are inherited and which
            are not. But if you are in doubt, you can check this information in the CSS3 module specifications,
            according to the rule of interest. There is a field for each property in the specification Inherited, which
            indicates inheritance.
            The CSS specification provides for the inheritance of properties, which are related to the text content of a
            page, such as colour, font. In many cases, this is convenient because you don't have to set the font size
            and font family for every element on the web page. Properties related to block formatting such as
            background, border, display, are not inherited. (These properties are discussed in more details throughout
            this module.)
            Force inheritance. With a keyword inherit an element can be forced to inherit a property from its parent
            element. This rule also works for properties, which are not inherited by default.
